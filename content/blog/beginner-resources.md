For my first blog post, I thought it would make sense to list my favorite lesser-known programming resources. I don't typically read textbooks, so if something's here, I found it worth the effort.
The resources are arranged vaguely from beginner to advanced, but I'm not attempting to lay out a course of study - these are just *some* things that have helped *me*.

- [*A Byte of Python*](https://python.swaroopch.com/) by Swaroop C. H.

    This was my first-ever exposure to programming, and I think it's still a pretty good place to start. Python is a simple, (mostly) sane language, which makes it a good one to start with, and Swaroop distills the basics without dumbing it down. I don't know if I'd have liked coding without this book. Probably, but maybe not!
- [*The Go Language*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIbUZ3URbL0Hn-2v6oB9nMfIfJPYDY9Nv) by Brian Will
    
    This was my go-to resource for reviewing Go when I had to help teach it a few semesters ago. It's a simple intro to a famously simple language, and it highlights both my favorite and least favorite  aspects of the language. It's surprisingly comprehensive for its ~1 hour 20 minute runtime, too. I also have to mention [*Storing Data in Control Flow*](https://research.swtch.com/pcdata) by Russ Cox, simply because it finally made me realize that concurrency can make code *way* simpler, even if it doesn't speed things up.
- [*Learn Rust with Entirely Too Many Linked Lists*](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/) by Aria Desires

    This one is *brilliant*. I've gotten through all of this except for the part implementing cursors. It mixes snark and content really well, and Rust is one of the most interesting new languages of the 21st century. Before starting, you should know how to write a linked-list in a language like C or C++. Exposure to functional languages (especially OCaml or F#) will also help, but isn't necessary.

I'll update this as I find other great resources.
