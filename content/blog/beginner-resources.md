For my first blog post, I thought it would make sense to list my favorite lesser-known programming resources. I don't typically read textbooks, so if something's here, I found it worth the effort.
The resources are arranged vaguely from beginner to advanced, but I'm not attempting to lay out a course of study - these are just *some* things that have helped *me*.

- [*A Byte of Python*](https://python.swaroopch.com/) by Swaroop C. H.

    This was my first-ever exposure to programming, and I think it's still a pretty good place to start. Python is a great language to start with and Swaroop does an excellent job distilling the important basics without dumbing it down too much. More than anything else on this list, this is a classic.
- [*The Go Language*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIbUZ3URbL0Hn-2v6oB9nMfIfJPYDY9Nv) by Brian Will
    
    This was my go-to resource for reviewing Go when I had to help teach it a few semester's ago. It's a simple intro to a famously simple language, and it highlights both my favorite and least favorite  aspects of the language. It's surprisingly comprehensive for it's ~1 hour 20 minute runtime, too, but of course you'll want to supplement. I also have to mention [*Storing Data in Control Flow*](https://research.swtch.com/pcdata) by Russ Cox, simply because it finally made me realize that concurrency can make code *way* simpler, even if it doesn't speed things up.
- [*Learn Rust with Entirely Too Many Linked Lists*](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/) by Aria Desires

    Okay, this one's also a classic. Full disclosure: I haven't quite gotten through this one - I'm still a little scared of unsafe, and I don't have time at the moment. But if snark helps you learn, and you want to learn one of the most influential new languages of the 21st century - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - I guarantee it's worth it. You should know how to write a linked-list before jumping in, and be prepared to read other resources on Rust - I recommend [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

I'll update this as I find other great resources.
