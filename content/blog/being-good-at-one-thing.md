title: 'The Humble Bluetooth Shower Speaker and Being *Really Good* at One Thing'
draft: true
---

## Outline:
- Bluetooth is great for shower speakers from a UX perspective:
    - It needs to be wireless (from the phone).
    - It oughta be wireless (from the wall).
    - It has a start and a stop. (Good times to press the power button.)
    - What else are gonna do with your phone in the shower?
        - If you get a call, aren't you gonna hang up or decline it? (Ehh... not sure how I feel about this next sentence.) If you're gonna take it, maybe you'll take it on the speaker anyway?
- It ain't great for much else (headphones).
- It was designed for headphones! Isn't that funny?
Conclusion:
- People get things wrong.
- We live in an age of technological marvels and abundance.
- It's nice to celebrate small, silly wonders. And voice small, silly gripes.
