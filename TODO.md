- Fix double-underlining of "Site Source Code".
Later:
- Reduce the number of font sizes on the initial landing page. There are quite a few, and it's pretty distracting!
- Somehow fix/address the bug that causes the "working with others" link to be broken.
- Update the links to the `My_Raytracing_Adventures` repository where appropriate when I change its name. These *should* have individual TODOs - emphasis on *should*.
